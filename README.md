# Zeotap_DataScience_Assignment
## Assignment Tasks: 
### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights 
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset. 
2. Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA. 
○ Write these insights in short point-wise sentences (maximum 100 words per 
insight). 
### Deliverables: 
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing your EDA code. 
● A PDF report with business insights (maximum 500 words). 
### Task 2: Lookalike Model 
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar 
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model should: 
● Use both customer and product information. 
● Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer. 
### Deliverables: 
● Give the top 3 lookalikes with there similarity scores for the first 20 customers 
(CustomerID: C0001 - C0020)  in Customers.csv. Form an “Lookalike.csv” which has 
just one map: Map<cust_id, List<cust_id, score>>   
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script explaining your model development. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
● Model accuracy and logic. 
● Quality of recommendations and similarity scores. 
### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering 
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information 
(from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv). 
● You have the flexibility to choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters in 
between(2 and 10)  
● Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index(Evaluation will be done on this). 
● Visualise your clusters using relevant plots. 
### Deliverables: 
● A report on your clustering results, including: 
○ The number of clusters formed. 
○ DB Index value. 
○ Other relevant clustering metrics. 
● A Jupyter Notebook/Python script containing your clustering code. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
● Clustering logic and metrics. 
● Visual representation of clusters.
